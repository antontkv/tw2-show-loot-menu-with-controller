# The Witcher 2 Show Loot Window with the controller

When playing with the controller you can't chose what to loot from the containers. It's auto loot by default. Even thought you can when playing with KB/M.

Ported this windows to controller UI. Except there is no button prompts.

- X button to take all.
- B button to exit.
- A button to take item.
- Up/Down movement.
